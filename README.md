Welcome to VerSe!

VerSe is a web application designed to help travellers and locals connecting to practice sports together in the Amsterdam area. 

From football to tenis, duos or larger teams, anything is possible! Create an activity, adding a description of what sport you would like to practice and how many people you would like to join you. Add a location to it and post it. That's it! Now people can browse through the activities, either by location via the interactive map or filtering by their preferred sport.

Found an activity that you like? Request to join, and once you're accepted, discuss the details directly with the activity host using the app's built-in chat!

Staying active and making friends while traveling was never this easy!



*VerSe was desgined and coded from scratch by a team of four, in only eight days of work.*
